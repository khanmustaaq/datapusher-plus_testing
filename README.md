# DataPusher+ Testing Suite
Automated testing suite for DataPusher+ extension functionality. This repository provides a complete pipeline using GitHub Actions to validate data processing workflows across multiple file formats including CSV, TSV, Excel, and JSON files.

## Requirements:
- CKAN v2.11+
- Datapusher+ v2+

## Key Features:
- Multi-format file testing 
- Real-time DataPusher job monitoring and status validation
- Automated datastore activation and data import verification
- Detailed test reporting with markdown summaries and downloadable artifacts
- Configurable test datasets and extensible file format support

Includes error handling, performance metrics, and detailed logging for troubleshooting extension issues.

## Steps to Testing with Your Own Files

1. Fork the repository
2. Add testing files in the tests/custom files directory
3. Head over to actions and run the `DataPusher+ Testing Run` workflow. Enter the configurables like the branch of the datapusher-plus, and the directory of the test files (default directory: quick)
4. Once the work flow gets completed, refer the artifacts in the Summary of the workflow

Inside you’ll find:
